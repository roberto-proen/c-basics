# C Basics

## 17/09/2023 - something like 6 hours of studying C

it has been almost 10 years that i didn't write anything in C, the idea of this project was just to remember myself of the basics, so i read throug https://www.w3schools.com/c/index.php, I was mainly focussed in rediscovering the basics things like pointers and linking, organizing code, at some time i got bored of typing the console commands over and over and created a simple .bat file to build run and clean the files.

it was also my first time writing a dynamicLibrary and loading it it also unlock the ability to write c/c++ dll and run it in unity for example.

next time I may try to implement a simple game with C in SDL;
